# Gradient Descent in Logistic Regression

## Overview

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm for logistic regression focused on predicting termite discovery from environmental and treatment-related features. Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used across a wide range of machine learning applications.

## What is Gradient Descent?

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of the function. This method is widely used in machine learning to find the optimal parameters of a model (e.g., weights in logistic regression) that minimize the cost function. The algorithm updates the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the function at the current point.

### Key Components of Gradient Descent:
- **Cost Function**: A function that measures the performance of a Machine Learning model for given data. Gradient Descent aims to minimize this function.
- **Learning Rate**: Determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum.
- **Convergence**: The point at which the cost function stops decreasing with each iteration and the parameters stabilize.

## Applications of Gradient Descent

While gradient descent can be applied to various optimization problems, in the context of machine learning, it is predominantly used to optimize the loss functions of models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it an ideal choice for problems with a large number of features and data points.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this subdirectory includes data on wood blocks treated under different conditions and exposed to termite habitats. Features include `initial_wt`, `final_wt`, among others, and the target variable is `termite_discovery`, indicating whether termites were discovered.

## Implementation in This Subdirectory

The Jupyter notebooks within this directory provide a step-by-step guide on:
- Preprocessing data: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature normalization.
- Implementing the gradient descent algorithm: Detailed Python code shows how the gradient descent is applied to logistic regression.
- Visualizing the convergence of the cost function: Plots illustrating how the cost decreases with each iteration of gradient descent, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or adapt the notebooks to your dataset:
1. Ensure Python and necessary packages (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`) are installed.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in order, executing each cell to see the progression of data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, and results visualization.

## Conclusion

This exploration of gradient descent provides an educational insight into its capabilities and limitations within the scope of logistic regression applied to termite discovery. It underscores the importance of choosing appropriate learning rates and the number of iterations to achieve effective model training.

## Termite Fun Fact
**Superfood Finders:** Some termite species are known to cultivate specialized fungi within their colonies, which they feed on. This symbiotic relationship between termites and fungi is similar to human agriculture.
