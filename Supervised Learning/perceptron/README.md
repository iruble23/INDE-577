# Perceptron Model Analysis on Termite Discovery

## Overview
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the perceptron model to predict termite discovery based on environmental and wood-related factors. The perceptron is a fundamental building block of neural networks, a binary classifier that makes predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

## Dataset Context
The dataset includes features like wood treatment, type of wood used, initial and final weights of wood blocks, and termite discovery occurrences. These features help to model the probability of termite presence, which is critical for preventing damage in susceptible areas.

## Model Implementation
We use the `Perceptron` class from the `sklearn.linear_model` module. This class provides an implementation of the perceptron algorithm which facilitates learning the weights and bias from the data, aiding in the classification of termite discovery.

## Usage
- **Initialization**: The perceptron is initialized with default parameters, but these can be adjusted depending on the dataset characteristics.
- **Training**: The model is trained on a subset of the data using the `fit` method, which takes the feature matrix and target vector as inputs.
- **Prediction**: After training, predictions can be made on new data using the `predict` method.

## Key Concepts
- **Binary Classification**: The perceptron is used for binary classification tasks, predicting either the presence or absence of termites.
- **Feature Importance**: Understanding which features strongly influence termite discovery can help in preventive measures.

## How to Run
Navigate to the notebook in this directory and execute the cells sequentially to observe how the perceptron model is implemented and evaluated.
